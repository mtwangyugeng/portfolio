# User Story: Name Formator for logogram names

### Just a bit a sugar for those who has a name compose of logogram that has a lot of homophones. This will add a CSS tooptip for each logogram sound with the description of user's choice. I personally prefer to use emojis for the description.  

- when visiter hover over a phonetic sound of a logogram, a description of the logogram meaning is given.

- usage example: `<NameFormater pairs = {[["Yu", "🌌"], ["Geng", "🧑‍🌾"], ["Wang", "👑"]]} englishName = "Simon"/>`
